# Coding-sample_Tobin_predoc

This is Kai-En (Joshua) Teh's coding samples, which showcase his programming skills and projects in R, Python, and Stata. This repository contains three file folders, each corresponding to one of the programming languages. The R and Stata folders consist of scripts and do-files that he has developed for teaching materials and theoretical modeling. Meanwhile, the Python folder primarily includes code that generates figures related to content analysis and text classification.
